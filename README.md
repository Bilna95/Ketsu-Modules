# Ketsu-Modules
These are the modules created by the Katsu/Ketsu/Zetsu community.
# How can I download Ketsu since it's not available in the App Store anymore ?
Orion's plan is to release the ipa (file format for ios apps) really soon, when it's available I'll do a tutorial to show you how to sideload it to your phone.
# You want me to make a module ? 
If you have a github account make a pull request with the name and type (Image, Video or text) of website you want. Or you can hit me up in the official [Ketsu discord](https://discord.gg/CP3Q6XBv9F) by just mentionning me @Nabil#0054.
