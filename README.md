# Ketsu-Modules
These are the modules created by the Katsu/Ketsu/Zetsu community.
# What is Ketsu ?
Ketsu is a modular application, which means that you can create your own modules and use them inside the app. You can use it to watch videos, read differents types of text and images. You can find the ipa file here [Ketsu](https://ketsu.app).
# How can I download Ketsu since it's not available in the App Store anymore ?
You can still sideload it on your phone for free with softwares like [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/).
You will find tutorials made by the creator in English [here](https://ketsu.app/download.html) and one in French made by me [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX2MAsUBdfQ).
# You want me to make a module ? 
If you have a github account make a pull request with the name and type (Image, Video or text) of website you want. Or you can hit me up in the official [Ketsu discord](https://discord.gg/CP3Q6XBv9F) by just mentionning me @Nabil#0054. Depending on the complexity on the module I can ask to be charged for it.
